# React Parcel Clustergrammer Example

This illustrates how to turn clustergrammer into a react component and how to use clustergrammer-web's API to obtain a `viz_json` for use with the component. You can also use the component directly *without* clustergrammer-web but will be unable to see clusters/ranks unless you compute them yourself.

This uses `parcel-bundler`, a convenient tool for bundling and serving javascript with little explicit configuration.

## Usage
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```
